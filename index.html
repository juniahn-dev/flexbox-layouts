            Ontario is set to bar employers from requiring Canadian work
            experience. It could open the door for some immigrants – but
            employment discrimination isn't black and white. For its size,
            Canada admits a lot of immigrants. In 2023, Canadian immigration
            authorities logged 526,000 new "permanent residents", or newcomers
            living in the country who are not yet citizens, to a country of
            roughly 38 million. By comparison, the US, which has nearly
            ten-times Canada's population, welcomed just more than a million
            newcomers in 2023. Yet these new Canadian permanent residents can
            find themselves frustrated when applying for a job that matches
            their educational experience. Canada's immigration system largely
            revolves around a skill-based "points" system that rewards foreign
            applicants with advanced degrees, yet researchers and newcomers
            alike consistently note how some immigrants seem to be shut out of
            qualifying job opportunities and forced to hustle low-wage,
            precarious jobs, regardless.

            "The story goes that you have a good resume, good experience and
            good education, but you don't have Canadian experience in the field,
            so we can't hire you," says Izumi Sakamoto, an associate professor
            at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and
            Public Policy, who studies immigrants. In November 2023, the Ontario
            government took what may seem like a bold step: it introduced Bill
            149, legislation to ban employers from requiring Canadian work
            experience when advertising for jobs in the country's most populous
            province. It also requires roughly 30 professional associations,
            regulatory bodies responsible for controlling who can work in fields
            such as medicine or teaching, to drop the policy. The legislation,
            part of a suite of employment-rule changes, is still moving through
            Ontario's legislature, but experts predict it to pass, potentially
            as soon as within the next few months, thanks to the ruling
            Progressive Conservative Party's commanding majority. Researchers
            and newcomer-employment professionals believe this ban is good step
            to help skilled immigrant applicants, who constantly face
            discrimination or disqualification based on where they received
            their degree or had work experience. However, there is rarely a
            smoking gun in cases of hiring discrimination, and this law doesn't
            necessarily fix that. "It's difficult to prove how they have been
            discriminated against to get the job," says Sakamoto. "Hiring
            practices are behind closed doors. We usually don't get the reasons
            why some people did not get hired."
